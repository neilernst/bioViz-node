This is a sample application for visualizing gene expression information in the brain, based on Brodmann's areas. It is using obfuscated data and no genes starting after letter E. The app is using Node.js for the server component, SVG and Javascript for the UI.

You can try out a working version of the app at [Heroku](http://bioviz.herokuapp.com).
